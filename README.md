# 🌾 Digital Krishi Advisor

A **real-time intelligent farming solution** that helps farmers make data-driven decisions about crop selection, irrigation, fertilization, and disease management — all based on **soil data, weather conditions, and market trends**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Smart Farming System enables farmers to:
- Upload soil test data or input values manually.
- Get **real-time crop recommendations** tailored to their location and soil.
- Receive **day-wise crop management plans** (fertilizer & irrigation schedules).
- Upload crop images for **disease detection** using ML models.
- Access **market price predictions** and selling suggestions.
- Get **alerts and notifications** through SMS/WhatsApp.

---

## 🧩 Features

### 🌱 Functional Features
- Soil data input and validation.
- AI-based crop recommendation.
- Real-time fertilizer and irrigation planning.
- Crop disease detection via image upload.
- Market trend analysis and pricing advice.
- Multi-language support for accessibility.
- Real-time notifications for farmers.

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Features
- Scalable backend supporting 1000+ concurrent users.
- Secure storage with data encryption.
- Low latency (<5 min alert delay).
- User-friendly UI for low-literacy users.
- Cloud-based and fault-tolerant deployment.

Notification Service (SMS / WhatsApp)
```

### 🔧 Components
- **Backend:** Flask / FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **ML Models:** Hosted via REST API
- **Frontend:** Web or mobile app with offline support
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS / GCP / Render
- **Notification API:** Twilio, WhatsApp, or Fast2SMS

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Types
- **Unit Testing:** Soil input parser, crop recommender, and alert modules.
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end data flow from soil input → recommendation → alert.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Pilot test with 10–20 farmers.
- **Performance Testing:** Check system latency under high load.
- **Security Testing:** Verify encryption, input sanitization, and file upload safety.

### Test Data
- Sample soil reports  
- Historical crop yield and price datasets  
- Crop disease image samples  

---

## 🛠️ Deployment

1. **Host Backend** on AWS / GCP / Render.  
2. **Deploy Database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL) with daily backup.  
3. **Expose ML Models** via REST endpoints.  
4. **Connect Frontend** to backend APIs via HTTPS.  
5. **Integrate Notifications** (Twilio / WhatsApp).  

### Scalability
- Auto-scaling backend servers.
- Caching frequent data to reduce latency.
- Load balancing for concurrent users.

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Track uptime, response time, and error rates.
- Monitor ML model performance and retrain as needed.
- Collect farmer feedback to improve UX.

### Maintenance
- Update ML models seasonally.
- Apply regular security patches.
- Daily backups of database and logs.
